--- abstract

Secure Sockets Layer version 3.0 (SSLv3) {{RFC6101}} is no longer secure.  This
document requires that SSLv3 not be used.  The replacement versions, in
particular Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 {{RFC5246}}, are considerably more
secure and capable protocols.

This document updates the backward compatibility sections of the TLS RFCs to
prohibit fallback to SSLv3.

# Introduction

The SSLv3 protocol has been subject to a long series of attacks, both on its key
exchange mechanism and on the encryption schemes it supports since it was
released in 1996.  Despite being replaced by TLS 1.0 {{RFC2246}} in 1999, and
subsequently TLS 1.1 in 2002 {{RFC4346}} and 1.2 in 2006 {{RFC5246}},
availability of these replacement versions has not been universal.  As a result,
many implementations of TLS have permitted the negotiation of SSLv3.

The predecessor of SSLv3, SSL version 2, is no longer considered secure
{{RFC6176}}.  SSLv3 now follows.

SSLv3 MUST NOT be used {{RFC2119}}.  Negotiation of SSLv3 from any version of TLS
MUST NOT be permitted.

This document updates Appendix E of {{RFC5246}}.  Clients MUST NOT set a record
layer version number (TLSPlaintext.version) of {03,00}; servers MAY continue to
accept SSLv3 handshakes from old clients.


# A Litany of Attacks

## Record Layer

The non-deterministic padding used in the CBC construction of SSLv3 further
trivially permits the recovery of plaintext {{POODLE}}.

The cipher block chaining (CBC) modes of SSLv3 use a flawed MAC-then-encrypt
construction that has subsequently been replaced in TLS versions {{RFC7366}}.
Unfortunately, the mechanism to correct this flaw relies on extensions: a
feature added in TLS 1.0.  SSLv3 cannot be updated to correct this flaw in the
same way.

The flaws in the CBC modes in SSLv3 are mirrored by the weakness of the stream
ciphers it defines.  Of those defined, only RC4 is currently in widespread use.
RC4, however, exhibits serious biases and is also no longer fit for use
{{I-D.ietf-tls-prohibiting-rc4}}.

This leaves SSLv3 with no suitable record protection mechanism.


## Key Exchange

The SSLv3 key exchange is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks when
renegotiation {{Ray09}} or session resumption {{TRIPLE-HS}} are used.
Each flaw has been fixed in TLS by means of extensions. Again,
SSLv3 cannot be updated to correct these flaws.


## Custom Cryptographic Primitives

SSLv3 defines custom constructions for PRF, HMAC and digital signature
primitives.  Such constructions lack the deep cryptographic scrutiny that
standard constructions used by TLS have received.  Furthermore, all SSLv3
primitives rely on SHA-1 {{RFC3174}} and MD5 {{RFC1321}}: these hash algorithms
are considered weak and are being systematically replaced with stronger hash
functions, such as SHA-256 {{FIPS180-2}}.


# Limited Capabilities

SSLv3 is unable to take advantage of the many features that have been added to
recent TLS versions.  This includes the features that are enabled by ClientHello
extensions, which SSLv3 does not support.

Though SSLv3 can benefit from new cipher suites, it cannot benefit from new
cryptographic modes.  Of these, the following are particularly prominent:

* Authenticated Encryption with Additional Data (AEAD) modes are added in
  {{RFC5246}}.

* Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) and Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)
  are added in {{RFC4492}}.

* Application layer protocol negotiation {{RFC7301}}.

* Stateless session tickets {{RFC5077}}.

* A datagram mode of operation, DTLS {{RFC6347}}.
